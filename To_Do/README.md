# 📝 My To-Do List App

## What is this?

This is a simple, clean, and functional **To-Do List web app** built using just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
No frameworks. No libraries. Just the good ol' building blocks of the web.

## Why did I build this?

I wanted to create something that’s genuinely useful, yet minimal — an app to track my tasks without the bloat.

Also, let’s be honest: sometimes you just want a to-do list that doesn’t ask you to sign up, verify your email, and download an update before you can write down “buy groceries.”

## Features

- ✅ **Add tasks** — Type it in, click "Add", done.
- ✅ **Mark tasks as completed** — One click to strike through.
- ✅ **Filter tasks** — Switch between All, Active, and Completed.
- ✅ **Clear completed tasks** — Declutter with a single button.
- ✅ **Live counter** — Shows how many tasks are left.

## How does it work?

- **HTML** handles the structure.
- **CSS** styles it with layout and basic responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** takes care of:
  - Adding and removing tasks.
  - Toggling completion status.
  - Filtering views (All / Active / Completed).
  - Updating the counter in real time.

> Note: It doesn't use localStorage yet, so tasks reset on page reload — feel free to add it!

## Want to Customize It?

- 🎨 Tweak the design in `styles.css`.
- 💾 Add localStorage or backend support in `script.js`.
- 🧠 Want tags, priorities, or drag-and-drop? Build it out!
